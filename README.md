# really-simple-multiple-ending-console-rpg
My first try at making a console game in c#(not done). The code is probably very messy but i fell i have improved a ton making this.

My understanding of access modifiers grew a ton making this.
my understanding of the switch statement also grew during this.

if you somehow need to use this code in something, feel free to.
